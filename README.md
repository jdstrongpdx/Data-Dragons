Project Description:
Neighborhoods should be vibrant communities with people from different households interacting and working together to make one another's lives better and easier. Additionally, with the cost of goods and services continually increasing, the need to come together to share resources as a community is higher than ever. One solution to aid in both of these problems is CloseKnit Bazaar, a web application that serves as a centralized hub for sharing of goods and services within a community. Missing your 10 mm socket head, or need your lawn mowed while out of town? Someone on CloseKnit Bazaar might have that on offer. Have some spare time and want to offer to walk someone's dog, or lend a pressure washer you hardly use? You can post an offer on CloseKnit Bazaar. Although sharing can be taken advantage of, we propose a system of exchange based on ‘Karma’ points rather than currency, which must be maintained above a minimum value to participate. When an offering is posted, the poster can specify a Karma amount to be paid by the receiver. This reputation based system of currency facilitates frequent offering and trading of otherwise underutilized resources resulting in a more connected community, monetary savings for participants, and increases the likelihood of individuals helping each other. The CloseKnit Bazaar web application is built to support an initial build size of 200 individual Neighborhoods, with a target of 65 of homes and 250 people per Neighborhood. As a startup, we are aiming to start in a limited geographical area, and support an initial 50,000 people.

As part of a term long project in Introduction to Databases, another classmate and I in a virtual setting built a web application in JavaScript and Node.Js using a MySQL database backend.
Together, we implemented the following requirements:
    Documented the data driven operational goals using narrative, ERD, and Schema models.
    Incorporated feedback at five different stages to normalize the schema and refine the project.
    Implemented backend code to perform SELECT and INSERT on six entities and DELETE and UPDATEs on one intersection entity. 
    Developed DDL code to create the schema, with example data to illustrate table functionality; performed periodic BACKUPs. 
    Wrote application code that implemented the UI front end in a third party hosted Linux environment. 
    Utilized git version control management to perform feature enhancements, bug fixes and project management.
